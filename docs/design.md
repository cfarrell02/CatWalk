# Game Design Doc

## Game Overview

This game follows a gameplay style similar to Frogger, where the player controls a cat navigating through a grid-based city. The cat can hop in four directions to cross roads while collecting points for each successful road crossing. The primary objectives include crossing roads before the camera progresses out of view and avoiding increasingly faster traffic as the game advances. If the player fails to avoid these, they die and reset, with the ultimate goal being to get the best highscore.

### Mobile Suitability

The game design is well-suited for mobile devices as shown below:

- **Session Lengths:** The game offers relatively short session lengths, enabling players flexibly with regards to starting and stopping gameplay conveniently.
- **Interruptions:** Seamless saving and loading mechanisms reduce the impact of interruptions on gameplay, ensuring a smoother gaming experience.
- **Touch Screen Integration:** Gesture-based controls enhance gameplay, ensuring easy and intuitive navigation through the game's mechanics.
